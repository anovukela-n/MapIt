# MapIt
code assessment API with map
This a Django web API application thaT uses a PostgreSQL 
It reads in a CSV file `tests. csv `located in the tracking app subdirectory.

The file contains tracking information on vehicles, it holds their location at different timestamps.
The API has the following functionality:
    * Start with the `Load`function to load the file data to the database at URL `load/records`
    * `get_records` which is a GET method that uses URL
    * `table` is a GET method that pulls data from the database in table form and works with delete and update
       use url `table`
    * `json`is a GET method that pulls data from the database in JSON format use url `api/json`
    * `create `POST method that creates a single record use url `api/create/`
    * `Delete<vehicleid >` deletes records use url `delete/<int:id>`
    * `Update <vehicleid>` updates records using the parameters use url`update/<int:id>`
    *`map` takes you to the map using the `map/`URL 

Planned improvements on the app:
*is improve CSS, and add a map 
*Add a `.env` file
*The map is not fully functional and next for improvement.
*the pages are not linked together with a back button or a Go Home button.

The construction is as follows 
* project directory `api_project`-> `api_project`` with the project file
* Django app `tracking` that holds the app as well as the `templates` and `statics` folder

Run the app by changing the directory to `the api_projet`  with the command `cd the api_projet `root directory, then run the `python manage.py runserver` command.Use can also use the GUI.
The API makes use of the PostgreSQL database system, the database is Mapping, the user is `Postgres` and the password is `password` and the table is `tracking_trackingData`.
the columns are from the CVS file with the exception of the id which is autogenerated.
